9,L9_Q1,"After a sudden power loss in the Core Engine, Zero finds realities that appear correct in memory snapshots but revert to older states on restart. These realities had recent changes acknowledged but not yet made durable. Identify such realities.","Memory lies when power dies.","SELECT DISTINCT r.id FROM realities r JOIN updates u ON r.id = u.reality_id JOIN durability_logs d ON u.update_id = d.update_id LEFT JOIN disk_flush_logs f ON u.update_id = f.update_id WHERE d.ack_time < u.end_time AND f.update_id IS NULL;","normal",0
9,L9_Q2,"Pixel discovers that some updates survived crashes while others vanished, even though both touched the same tables. The difference lies in the order changes reached persistent records. Identify updates vulnerable to partial persistence.","Order of persistence matters.","SELECT u.update_id FROM updates u JOIN update_steps us ON u.update_id = us.update_id JOIN page_write_logs pw ON us.page_id = pw.page_id LEFT JOIN wal_records w ON u.update_id = w.update_id WHERE w.update_id IS NULL;","normal",1500
9,L9_Q3,"Nyx suspects torn writes where only part of a structure reached disk before the crash, corrupting internal pointers. Identify pages that were written but never fully sealed.","Half-written pages betray corruption.","SELECT p.page_id FROM page_write_logs p LEFT JOIN page_checksum_logs c ON p.page_id = c.page_id WHERE c.page_id IS NULL;","normal",3000
9,L9_Q4,"Zero notices recovery logic replayed some changes twice, inflating counts silently. These changes were recorded in persistence logs but already applied to data pages. Identify such duplicated recoveries.","Idempotence failure causes ghosts.","SELECT w.update_id FROM wal_records w JOIN page_write_logs p ON w.page_id = p.page_id WHERE w.apply_sequence < p.write_sequence;","normal",4500
9,L9_Q5,"Pixel finds that buffer memory evicted dirty pages under pressure, but their persistence order violated safety guarantees.

9,L9_Q7,"Zero detects realities that passed all correctness checks yet recover incorrectly because crash windows overlapped with background maintenance operations.

9,L9_Q8,"Pixel suspects that some updates appear durable but were only acknowledged due to delayed IO scheduling.

9,L9_BOSS2,"FINAL BOSS: The Storage Engine itself fractures. Zero must isolate realities where acknowledgments preceded persistence, torn pages exist, recovery replayed changes incorrectly, background operations overlapped crashes, and write amplification magnified the damage.","This is a disk-level apocalypse.","SELECT DISTINCT r.id FROM realities r JOIN updates u ON r.id = u.reality_id JOIN durability_logs d ON u.update_id = d.update_id JOIN wal_records w ON u.update_id = w.update_id LEFT JOIN page_checksum_logs c ON w.page_id = c.page_id JOIN crash_logs cr ON d.ack_time BETWEEN cr.start_time AND cr.end_time JOIN maintenance_logs m ON r.id = m.reality_id WHERE c.page_id IS NULL AND w.apply_sequence < (SELECT MAX(write_sequence) FROM page_write_logs);","boss",18000
