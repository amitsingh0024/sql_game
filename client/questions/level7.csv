7,L7_Q1,"In the Vault of Stability, Zero finds realities that look calm now but were once exposed to impossible intermediate states during massive transformations touching many subsystems. These realities show no permanent sealing or reversal records, yet observers briefly saw them change.

7,L7_Q3,"Nyx suspects realities where attempts to recover from failure caused deeper instability because only some subsystems reverted while others stayed altered.

7,L7_Q4,"Observers recorded conflicting versions of the same reality at the same moment.
