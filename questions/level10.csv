10,L10_Q1,"After a massive network split, Zero finds realities where changes were accepted in multiple places at the same logical moment, yet their final states disagree once the network healed. Identify such realities.","Truth diverged during isolation.","SELECT DISTINCT r.id FROM realities r JOIN replica_updates ru ON r.id = ru.reality_id GROUP BY r.id, ru.logical_time HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ru.replica_id) > 1 AND COUNT(DISTINCT ru.state_hash) > 1;","normal",0
10,L10_Q2,"Pixel notices that some updates appear twice in global history, even though they were initiated only once. These duplicates surfaced after retries during unstable communication. Identify such updates.","Retries without coordination duplicate truth.","SELECT update_id FROM replica_updates GROUP BY update_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT replica_id) > 1 AND COUNT(DISTINCT commit_sequence) > 1;","normal",2000
10,L10_Q3,"Nyx suspects realities where operations were applied in different orders across replicas, producing subtle but lasting divergence. Identify realities where replica operation order disagrees.","Order matters more than content.","SELECT r.id FROM realities r JOIN replica_updates ru ON r.id = ru.reality_id GROUP BY r.id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT ru.apply_order) > 1;","normal",4000
10,L10_Q4,"Zero uncovers realities that accepted changes based on local clocks that drifted apart, making later reconciliation impossible. Identify replicas whose perceived time moved backward or jumped unexpectedly.","Time lies when clocks drift.","SELECT replica_id FROM replica_time_logs GROUP BY replica_id HAVING MAX(logical_time) < MAX(physical_time) OR MIN(physical_time) > MIN(logical_time);","normal",6000
10,L10_Q5,"Pixel finds realities that appeared stable locally but violated global uniqueness once replicas synchronized. Identify realities where the same unique identity was accepted independently.","Uniqueness breaks without coordination.","SELECT reality_id FROM replica_constraints GROUP BY reality_id, unique_key HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT replica_id) > 1;","normal",8000
10,L10_Q6,"Nyx identifies operations that were acknowledged to clients even though they never reached a majority of replicas. These operations vanished after leadership changed.

10,L10_Q8,"Pixel detects realities where reads returned values that were never globally agreed upon, due to reading from lagging replicas.

10,L10_Q9,"Nyx suspects that some operations claim to execute exactly once, but network retries caused multiple partial applications across replicas.

10,L10_BOSS1,"BOSS FIGHT: The Consensus Hydra fractures reality by exploiting partitions, retries, and time drift.
