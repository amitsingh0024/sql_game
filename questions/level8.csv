8,L8_X_Q1,"In the deepest chamber of the Dragon Database, Zero finds realities that remained logically correct yet slowed catastrophically as population grew. The slowdown followed structure height, not record count, and worsened under concurrent access.

To weaken it, Zero must identify realities where deep structure traversal, silent index failure, stale plans, cache thrashing, and concurrency amplification all occur together.","This is structural collapse.","SELECT DISTINCT r.id FROM realities r JOIN query_logs q ON r.id = q.reality_id JOIN query_plans p ON q.query_id = p.query_id JOIN index_stats i ON q.index_id = i.index_id JOIN buffer_pool_stats b ON q.query_id = b.query_id WHERE i.tree_height > 4 AND q.used_index = false AND p.plan_age > p.statistics_refresh_interval AND b.cache_evictions > 0 AND q.concurrent_executions > 10;","boss",12500
